# Argonone-Retropie
I do NOT take credit for writing the lines of code and I do NOT take responsebility for any loss of function in regards to your RPi.

Modified setup script for the Argon One case for Raspberry Pi 4. This script should render the functions (fan and power button) of the case compatible with non-official distros like RetroPie.
